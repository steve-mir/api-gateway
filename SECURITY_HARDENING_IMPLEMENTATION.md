## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture

The security hardening implementation follows a modular architecture where each security component is independent but can work together through the `SecurityManager`. This design allows for:

- Easy testing of individual components
- Flexible configuration per environment
- Scalable security feature additions
- Clear separation of concerns

### Performance Considerations

- **Async/Await**: All security operations are fully async to prevent blocking
- **Concurrent Data Structures**: Uses `DashMap` and `Arc<RwLock>` for thread-safe operations
- **Memory Efficiency**: Implements proper memory management with Arc/Weak references
- **Caching**: IP reputation and validation results are cached for performance

### Security Best Practices

- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security validation
- **Fail Secure**: All security checks fail securely by default
- **Audit Trail**: Complete audit logging for compliance
- **Input Sanitization**: All input is validated and sanitized
- **Secure Defaults**: Production-ready secure configurations by default
