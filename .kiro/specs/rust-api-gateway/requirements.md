# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for building a comprehensive API Gateway in Rust designed for containerized deployment in Kubernetes clusters. The gateway will serve as a unified entry point for multiple communication protocols (gRPC, REST, WebSocket) with advanced traffic management, security, and observability features. The implementation will include extensive documentation and comments to help developers new to Rust but experienced in other languages like Go and Python.
