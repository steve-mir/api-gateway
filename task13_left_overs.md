‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED FEATURES:
1. HTTP/2 Support - ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
‚úÖ Configuration structures exist (Http2Config)
‚úÖ Server checks for HTTP/2 enabled flag
‚ö†Ô∏è ISSUE: HTTP/2 is enabled by default in Axum/Hyper but no specific HTTP/2 stream management is implemented
‚ö†Ô∏è ISSUE: The server logs "HTTP/2 support enabled" but doesn't actually configure HTTP/2-specific features
2. Request/Response Compression - ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
‚úÖ Configuration structures exist (CompressionConfig)
‚úÖ Dependencies are in Cargo.toml (flate2, brotli)
‚úÖ Compression layer is created in server setup
‚úÖ Admin endpoints for compression management exist
‚ö†Ô∏è ISSUE: Compression is applied at middleware level but not integrated into the main request processing pipeline
3. CORS Handling - ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
‚úÖ Configuration structures exist (CorsConfig)
‚úÖ CORS layer is created and configured in server setup
‚úÖ Admin endpoints for CORS management exist
‚úÖ CORS testing endpoint exists
‚ö†Ô∏è ISSUE: CORS middleware is applied but the actual CORS processing happens at Tower middleware level, not in the gateway's request handler
4. OpenAPI/Swagger Integration - ‚ùå PLACEHOLDER ONLY
‚úÖ Configuration structures exist (OpenApiConfig)
‚úÖ Admin endpoints exist
‚ùå MAJOR ISSUE: OpenAPI validation is completely placeholder - no actual validation occurs
‚ùå MAJOR ISSUE: The validate_request and validate_response methods are empty placeholders
5. Request Timeout and Deadline Propagation - ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
‚úÖ Timeout configuration exists (HttpTimeoutConfig)
‚úÖ Request timeout is applied in the main handler
‚úÖ Admin endpoints for timeout management exist
6. Admin Endpoints for HTTP Feature Configuration - ‚úÖ FULLY IMPLEMENTED
‚úÖ Complete admin API exists in src/admin/http_management.rs
‚úÖ All HTTP features have dedicated admin endpoints
‚úÖ Configuration history tracking
‚úÖ Validation and testing endpoints
üîß CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND:
Integration Gap Issues:
HTTP/2 Runtime Integration - The HTTP/2 configuration exists but isn't actively used in the server implementation. The gateway server doesn't have HTTP/2-specific handling beyond basic Axum/Hyper defaults.

Compression Runtime Integration - While compression structures exist and dependencies are in Cargo.toml, the actual compression middleware isn't integrated into the request pipeline where it would compress responses.

CORS Runtime Integration - CORS configuration exists but the actual CORS middleware operates at the Tower layer, not integrated with the gateway's custom request processing.

OpenAPI Validation Runtime - The OpenAPI validator is a complete placeholder implementation that doesn't perform any actual validation.

Implementation Issues:
Several unused imports in src/protocols/http.rs (though not critical)
The advanced HTTP features are configured but not actively used in the main request processing pipeline
Some features like OpenAPI validation are placeholder implementations
SUMMARY:
The task is approximately 70% complete. The configuration, admin endpoints, and basic structure are all implemented, but there are significant integration gaps where the features aren't actually applied during request processing. The OpenAPI validation is the most critical missing piece as it's completely non-functional.
